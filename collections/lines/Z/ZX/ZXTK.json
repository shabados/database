(6) (1)\nThere are glimpses and glimpses (of the Beloved) all over, but where is the eye to appreciate them?\nThere is the Mount Sinai all over, and there are leaping flames of His glow and refulgence. (6) (2)\nIf you have a head on your body, you should go to Him and place it on His lotus feet;\nAnd, if you have life in you which you value very much, then sacrifice it for Him. (6) (3)\nIf you have a hand, then grab and hold tight the corner of His robe.\nIf your feet are anxious (or have the strength) to walk, then start walking fast towards Him. (6) (4)\nIf we have ears that have perfect hearing then they should not hear anything other than the Naam of Akaalpurakh.\nIf our tongue has the power to speak, then it should utter mystic expressions. (6) (5)\nA Brahmin is a devotee of his idol and a Muslim of his shrine;\nI am enamored wherever I find an adorer-connoisseur of 'devotion'.\" (6) (6)"
