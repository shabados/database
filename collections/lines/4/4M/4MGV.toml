(482)\nThis command of the perfect and true Guru transforms your body of copper into that of gold,\nAnd, this gold is realized only through the memory of Akaalpurakh. (483)\nThis materialistic gold is destructible and is the root cause and whirlpool of  numerous problems and conflicts,\nThe gold of meditation, however, like the Entity of Omnipresent and True Waaheguru is permanent. (484)\nThe (true) wealth is in the dust of the feet of the noble and accepted souls,\nIt is such a true wealth that it is above and beyond any damage or loss. (485)\nYou must have noticed that every spring brings in the autumn,\nAlthough the spring keeps coming into this world again and again. (486)\nHowever, this meditational form of spring remains fresh and new till the doomsday,\nO Akaalpurakh! Kindly keep the influence of the evil eye far away from this spring . (487)\nAnyone who happens to obtain the collyrium of the dust of the feet of the holy persons,\nRest assured that his face will shine like the brilliance and radiance of the divine sun. (488)\nEven though spiritually enlightened person lives in this world,\nHe, in fact, is always a seeker-devotee of the Waaheguru. (489)\nHe meditates and describes His virtues every breath of his life,\nAnd, he recites verses of His Naam every moment in His honor. (490)\nThey keep directing their hearts and concentrating towards thoughts about Him,\nThey make their intellect fragrant with the aroma of the memory of Akaalpurakhb in every breath. (491)\nHe always concentrates and is united with the Almighty at all times,\nAnd, he has been able to achieve the real fruits of this life. (492)\nThe real fruits of this life lies with the Guru,\nAnd, silent repetition and meditation of His Naam is always on his tongue and the lips. (493)\nThe true Guru is the apparent glimpse of Akaalpurakh,\nTherefore, you should listen to His mysteries from his tongue. (494)\nA true Guru is indeed a perfect personification of the image of God,\nAnd, the image of Akaalpurakh always abides in his heart. (495)\nWhen His image resides permanently in someone's heart,\nThen, just one word of Akaalpurakh settles down in the depths of his heart. (496)\nI have threaded these grains of pearls into a necklace,\nSo that this arrangement may make the ignorant hearts aware of the secrets of Waaheguru. (497)\n(This compilation) Like a cup is filled to the brim with the divine elixir,\nThat is why, it has been given the name 'Zindagee Naamaa'. (498)\nFrom his speeches emerges the fragrance of divine knowledge,\nWith it, the knot (mysteries and suspicions) of the heart of the world is untangled. (499)\nWhosoever recites this with the grace and compassion of Waaheguru,\nHe receives laurels among the enlightened persons. (500)\nThis volume contains description and delineation of sacred and divine men;\nThis description lightens up the intelligence and the wisdom. (501)\nO informed person! In this volume,\nthere is no other word or expression except the words or expressions of remembrance and meditation of  Akaalpuralkh. (502)\nRemembrance of Waaheguru is the treasure of the enlightened minds,\nEverything else other than the meditation of Waaheguru is (absolutely) useless. (503)\nDo not read or even look at any word or expression except the ones about meditation of the Omnipotent,\nRemembrance of God, yes remembrance of God, and only remembrance of God. (504)\nO Akaalpurakh! Kindly make every withered and disheartened mind green and confident again,\nAnd, refresh and rejuvenate every wilted and languishing mind. (505)\nO Waaheguru! Kindly help this person, yours truly,\nAnd, make every ashamed and timid person successful and triumphant. (506)\nO Akaalpurakh! (Kindly) bless the heart of Goyaa with the yearning of love (for You),\nAnd, bestow upon the tongue of Goyaa just one particle of the fondness for Your love. (507)\nSo that he would not meditate or remember anyone other than the Lord,\nAnd, so that he would not learn or recite any other lesson except that of the love and devotion for Waaheguru. (508)\nSo that he would not speak any other word except the meditation and remembrance of Akaalpurakh,\nSo that he would not recite or read any other word or expression except that the one(s) on the concentration of spiritual thought. (509)\n(O Akaalpurakh!) Kindly make my eyes refulgent with glow by blessing  me with a glimpse of the Almighty,\nKindly remove everything from my heart except the entity of God. (510)\nGanj Nama\nEvery morning and evening, my heart and soul,\nMy head and forehead with faith and clarity (1)\nShall sacrifice for my Guru,\nAnd sacrifice with humility by bowing my head millions of times. (2)\nBecause, he created angels out of ordinary human beings,\nAnd, he elevated the status and honor of the earthly beings. (3)\nAll those honored by Him are, in fact, the dust of His feet,\nAnd, all gods and goddesses are willing to sacrifice themselves for Him. (4)\nEven though, thousands of moons and suns might be shinig,\nStill the whole world will be in pitch darkness without Him. (5)\nHoly and chaste Guru is the image of Akaalpurakh Himself,\nThat is the reason that I have settled Him inside my heart. (6)\nThose persons who do not contemplate Him,\nTake it that they have wasted the fruit of their heart and soul for nothing. (7)\nThis field loaded with cheap fruits,\nWhen he looks at them to his heart's content, (8)\nThen he gets a special kind of pleasure to look at them,\nAnd, he runs towards them to pluck them. (9)\nHowever, he does not get any results from his fields,\nAnd, returns disappointed hungry, thirsty and debilitated. (10)\nWithout Satguru, you should consider everything to be like as if\nThe field is ripe and grown but full of weeds and thorns. (11)\nPehlee Paatshaahee (Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji)\nThe first Sikh Guru, Guur Nanak Dev Ji, was the one who glistened the true and all-powerful refulgence of the Almighty and to highlight the significance of knowledge of complete faith in Him.\nHe was the one who elevated the flag of eternal spirituality and eliminated the darkness of ignorance of divine enlightenment and who took upon his own shoulders the responsibility of propagating the message of Akaalpurakh.\nBeginning from the earliest time to the present world, everyone considers himself to be the dust at his door;\nThe highest-ranked, the Lord, Himself sings his praises; and his disciple-student is the divine lineage of Waaheguru Himself.\nEvery fourth and sixth angel is unable to describe Guru's eclat in their expressions; and his radiance filled flag is flying over both the worlds.\nExamples of his command are the brilliant rays emanating from the Provident and when compared to him, millions of suns and moons get drowned in the oceans of darkness.\nHis words, messages and orders are the supreme for the people of the world and his recommendations rank absolutely first in both the worlds.\nHis true titles are the guide for both the worlds; and his true disposition is the compassion for the sinful.\nThe gods in the court of Waaheguru consider it a privilege to kiss the dust of his lotus feet and the angles of the higher court are slaves and servitors of this mentor.\nBoth the ens (N's) in his name depict nurturer, nourisher ans neighborly (boons, support and benefactions); the middle A represents the Akaalpurakh, and the last K represents the Ultimate great prophet.\nHis mendicancy raises the bar of detachment from the worldly distractions to the highest level and his generosity and benevolence prevails all over both the worlds. (12)\nWaaheguru is the Truth,\nWaaheguru is Omnipresent\nHis name is Nanak, the emperor and his religion is the truth,\nAnd that, there has not been another prophet like him who emanated in this world. (13)\nHis mendicancy (by precept and practice) lifts the head of saintly living to lofty heights,\nAnd, in his view, everyone should be prepared to venture his life for the principles of truth and noble deeds. (14)\nWhether special person of high status or ordinary people, whether angels or\nWhether onlookers of the heavenly court, all of them are desirous-petitioners of the dust of his lotus feet. (15)\nWhen God Himself is showering praises on him, what can I add to that?\nIn fact, how should I travel on the path of approbations? (16)\nMillions from the world of souls, the angels, are his devotees,\nAnd, millions of people from this world are also his disciples. (17)\nGods of the metaphysical world are all willing to sacrifice themselves for him,\nAnd, even all the angels of the spiritual world are also prepared to follow suit. (18)\nPeople of this world are all his creations as angels,\nAnd, his glimpse is clearly manifested on the lips of everyone. (19)\nAll his associates enjoying his company become knowledgeable (of spiritualism)\nAnd, they begin to describe the glories of Waaheguru in their speeches. (20)\nTheir honor and esteem, status and rank and name and imprints stay in this world forever;\nAnd, the chaste Creator bestows upon them a higher rank than others. (21)\nWhen the prophet of both the world addressed\nThrough his benefaction, the all-powerful Waaheguru, he said (22)\nThen he said, \"I am Your servitor, and I am Your slave,"
