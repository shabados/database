(34)\nMy charms and spells bring the dead back alive,\nAnd, those who are living (in sin) kill them. (35)\nMy charms transform the 'fire' into ordinary water,\nAnd, with the ordinary water, they extinguish and cool off the fires. (36)\nMy charms do whatever they like;\nAnd, they mystify with their spell all material and non-material things. (37)\nPlease divert their path in my direction,\nSo that they can adopt and acquisition my words and message. (38)\nThey do not go for any spells except My meditation,\nAnd, they do not move in any direction other than towards My door. (39)\nBecause they have been spared of the Hades,\nOtherwise, they would fall with their hands tied down. (40)\nThis whole world, from one end to the other,\nIs relaying the message that this world is cruel and corrupt. (41)\nThey do not realize any grief or happiness because of me,\nAnd, without me, they all are confused and perplexed. (42)\nThey congregate and from the stars\nThey count the number of days of sorrow and happiness. (43)\nThen they pen down their good and not-so-good fortunes in their horoscopes,\nAnd say, sometimes before and other times afterwards, as: (44)\nThey are not firm and consistent in their meditation chores,\nAnd, they talk and project themselves like confused and perplexed persons. (45)\nDivert their attention and face towards My meditation\nSo that they will not consider anything other than discourses about Me as their friend. (46)\nSo that I could set their worldly tasks on the right path,\nAnd, I could improve and refine their inclinations and tendencies with the divine glow. (47)\nI have created you for this purpose\nSo that you should be the leader to steer the whole world towrads the right path. (48)\nYou should dispel the love for dualism from their hearts and minds,\nAnd, you should direct them towards the true path. (49)\nThe Guru (Nanak) said, \"How can I be so capable of this stupendous task"
