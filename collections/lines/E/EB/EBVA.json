(30) (2)\nIt is said, according to the doctor of love, that no one, except the Waaheguru, knows the pain and suffering of separation.\nNo one listens to the sad stories of the destitute (has a cure to their pains and sorrows). (30) (3)\nIf you want to see the light for your eyes of your heart, then understand,\nThat no better collyrium than the dust of the foyer of the Beloved. (30) (4)\nA person should spend his whole life in the memory of his Beloved,\nBecause, there is no other medicine compared to this treatment. (30) (5)\nI wish I could sacrifice the entire wealth of this world and my life itself for Him,\n(He is such an Entity) that unless I do so and surrener completely, I cannot reach Him, the destination.\" (30) (6)"
