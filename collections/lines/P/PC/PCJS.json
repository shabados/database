(20) (1)\nAll his (Guru's) glow and grace are visible without a camouflage,\nWhen we are under the garb of ego, what can even a moon-like serene face do for us? (20) (2)\nOne who does not have any momentary direction or stability in his mind,\nWhat can a placid spot or a quiet nook of a mansion do for him?\" (20) (3)"
