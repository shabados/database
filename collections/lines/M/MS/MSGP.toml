(31) (3)\nIf you can meet the Providence, consider it as a miracle;\nIn fact, search for Him is the highst prize for his seekers.

(31) (5)\nA sugar bubble is no match to the beauty and touch of your closed lips,\nThis is not a cliché. It is the truth unsurpassed. This is the best example that I can present here.
