(48) (1)\nWe have been driven farther away from the Almighty due to our egos;\nTherefore, get rid of your vanity; do not be driven by the whims of your mind, then you can see clearly the Reality, the Beneficient. (48) (2)\nThe real lovers (of God) are always imbued in His love,\nO you bragger! Do not boast before them about love and devotion. (48) (3)\nYou should give up the sensual pleasures of all the five sense organs,\nSo that you could really taste the savor of a clean glass of holy elixir. (48) (4)\nGoyaa says, \"We should always be seeking and on the look out for the path of our Satguru,"
