Someone would kindly save me.\" (15) (5)\nJust as a drunk is only looking for and is concerned with a wine glass with ruby-colored drink (wine or alcohol),\nSimilarly, a thirsty person needs a glass of cold sweet water to quench his thirst, a glass of wine is not relevant. (16) (1)\nThe company of the devotees of Akaalpurakh is saturated with radiance;\nThis is all the association that the seekers of Waaheguru really need. (16) (2)\nOne can make this world a beautiful garden with one's smile,\nWhy would one need a gardener, after he had a glimpse of heavenly Him?(16) (3)\nOne of your loving and affectionate glances is enough to take away my breath,\nBut, still, I plead before Him for mercy and this is what I need the most. (16) (4)\nGoyaa is addressing the Guru: \"I have no one else but you in both the worlds."
