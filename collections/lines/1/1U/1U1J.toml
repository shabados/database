(12)\nThe fiendish has the intention to destroy us,\nOn the other hand, my vulnerable mind is expecting help and relief  from the Almighty;\nThe brute is concerned as to what should He do with him?\nAnd, we are concerned as to how does the Almighty respond to our plea? (13)\nWhat did we gain from this priceless life?\nWe were able to achieve the remembrance of the Omnipotent in both the worlds;\nThis personality of ours was a huge monster,\nWhen we gave up our ego and vanity, we attained the Ultimate, the Lord. (14)\nWe obtained collyrium from the dust of Your door;\nBecause of which we gained the prosperity and progress;\nWe have never bowed before anyone other than You,\nWe have discovered the symptoms of the Omnipresent within the abode of our heart. (15)\nGoyaa says, \"I have been able to get the inkling about the \"kaalpurakh from His remembrance,\nOtherwise, how could I have obtained this full-to-the-brim cup of devotion and affection?\nExcept the seeker of Lord, no one else is destined to have\nThis valuable treasure that I have had the good fortunate to obtain.\" (16)"
