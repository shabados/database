(5)\nThis body of yours is like a cloud under which is hidden the Sun (God),\nRemember to engage yourself in the divine devotion because this is the only purpose (fruit) of this life. (6)\nWhosoever has become cognizant of the mysteries of Waaheguru,\nHe has no other purpose except to remember Him every moment of his life. (7)\nWhat is the truth?  It is the memory of the Almighty that is the stark truth;\nIn fact, how can a fistful of dirt or dust, the human body, appreciate His real value? (8)\nIf you have the good fortune to have the company and association of the noble persons,\nThen my friend! You would have attained eternal wealth. (9)\nThis (God given) wealth is meant to be used in the service of  His creations, the people;\nEvery beggar and emperor is willing to sacrifice himself for it, the true wealth. (10)\nO brother! You should acquire the traits of those who constantly remember  the Beneficent;\nAnd, you should circle around the (street) locality they reside in again and again (so that you may get an opportunity to be blessed with their company.) (11)\nIf anyone keeps going around the streets of these noble souls,\nHe would have attained the light and radiance of the sun and the moon in both the worlds. (12)\n(We must realize) that meditation is an eternal treasure;\nTherefore, we should engage ourselves in meditation, worship and prayers before the Almighty. (13)\nThe entire kingdom (of the world) is encompassed in the remembrance of (the Naam of) Waaheguru;\nAnd, it is only His realm extending from the moon to the sun. (14)\nAnyone who is oblivious and unmindful of (the existence of) Akaalpurakh, consider him as an idiot;\nNo matter whether he is a beggar or the emperor king. (15)\nThe love of God is the loftiest of all the traits for us,\nAnd His shadow (on our heads) is like a tiara on our heads. (16)\nDevotion for Akaalpurakh is considered as Aremembrance of Him\","
