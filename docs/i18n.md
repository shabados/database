# Internationalization

To capture the multilingual nature of the database, fields can be represented by script strings or language strings.

## Language Strings

Language strings are used represent content in multiple languages, regardless of the script. E.g. "Hello" in English, "Hola" in Spanish, "Hallo" in German.

We reference the [ISO 639-1 language codes standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) for language string codes.

## Script Strings

Script strings are used to represent the written script of a language. E.g. Gurmukhi, Latin, Arabic, etc. These are often used for names, titles, etc, where the same content may be written in different scripts.

We reference the [ISO 15924 script codes standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924) for script string codes.

## Collections

A multilingual field will appear as an object with the language/script fields. E.g:

```json
{
  // Language field
  "greeting": {
    "en": "Hello",
    "es": "Hola",
    "de": "Hallo",
    "pa": "ਸਤ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ"
  },
  // Script field
  "name": {
    "Latn": "ganj-nâme",
    "Guru": "ਗੰਜ ਨਾਮਾ",
    "Aran": "گنجنامه"
  }
}
```

or, in TOML:

```toml
[greeting]
en = "Hello"
es = "Hola"
de = "Hallo"
pa = "ਸਤ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ"
```
